[ ] take some trades to see if the 1% really works (testing if it works)
  - i had a TP trade (screenshot) $1000 acc (it was a limit order i saw)
    - the app said: Profit: 8.96 USDT (+0.896%)
    - bybit new balance = 1007.19 USDT (+0.719%)
    - 
WHAT I CAN DO: just check real entry point in bybit and put that calculations in my tool and see

[ ] - retry to place order everytime the (new way) order id in the watchOrderSubmit is not in the array: openOrders
[ ] - move the alert out of bybit api create order because with postonly it sometimes doesnt come trough

maybe ask chatgpt
can be, spread? or slippage?
ask chatgpt what it could be, maybe we need add calculatePotentialProfit makerfees *2? im not sure

maybe: we should do the fees *2 everywhere, for opening and closing
